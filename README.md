**XM SendSecure** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secure exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

XM SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
**JavaScript**,
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).


# sendsecure-js

**This library allows you to use the XM SendSecure Web API via JavaScript (Server or Client).**

With this library, you will be able to:
* Authenticate SendSecure users
* Create new SafeBoxes

# Installation

## Prerequisites

sendsecure-js is written following the EcmaScript2015 standard, which may not be fully supported by all the browsers out there.
However, to get away with this setback we're using [Rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org) and [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) for bundling
and transpiling the code to something runnable for the browser or node.

- Node 6.5+ OR Firefox 49+, Chrome 49+, Edge 14+
- The XM SendSecure solution, provided by [XMedius](https://www.xmedius.com?source=sendsecure-js) (demo accounts available on demand)

## Install Package

```
git clone https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js.git
cd <path_to_sendsecure-js>/sendsecure-js
npm install
```

# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token (and the user ID).

### Server (Node.js)

```javascript
var SendSecure = require ('{YOUR_PATH}/sendsecure-js/build/sendsecure.cjs.min.js')
SendSecure.Client.getUserToken("deathstar", "darthvader", "d@Rk$1De", "DV-TIE/x1", "TIE Advanced x1", "The Force App")
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

### Client (Browser)

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input type="file" id="input">
    <script src="{YOUR_PATH}/sendsecure-js/build/sendsecure.iife.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      SendSecure.Client.getUserToken("deathstar", "darthvader", "d@Rk$1De", "DV-TIE/x1", "TIE Advanced x1", "The Force App")
        .then(console.log)
        .catch(console.error);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SafeBox Creation (Using SafeBox Helper Class)

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

### Server (Node.js)

```javascript
var SendSecure = require ('{YOUR_PATH}/sendsecure-js/build/sendsecure.cjs.min.js')

var userEmail = 'darthvader@empire.com',
      token = 'USER|1d495165-4953-4457-8b5b-4fcf801e621a',
      userId = '123456',
      enterpriseAccount = 'deathstar',
      endpoint = 'https://portal.xmedius.com';

var safebox = new SendSecure.Helpers.Safebox({ userEmail: userEmail,
                                               subject: 'Family matters',
                                               message: 'Son, you will find attached the evidence.'});

var recipient = new SendSecure.Helpers.Participant( { email: 'lukeskywalker@rebels.com' } );
var contactMethod = new SendSecure.Helpers.ContactMethod({ destinationType: "cell_phone", destination: "+15145550000" });
recipient.guestOptions.addContactMethod(contactMethod);
safebox.participants.push(recipient);

safebox.attachments.push(new SendSecure.Helpers.Attachment("Birth_Certificate.pdf"));
var client = new  SendSecure.Client(userId, token, enterpriseAccount, endpoint);
client.submitSafebox(safebox)
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

### Client (Browser)

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <script src="{YOUR_PATH}/sendsecure-js/build/sendsecure.iife.min.js"></script>

  <body>
    <input type="file" id="input">
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var inputElement = document.getElementById("input");
      inputElement.addEventListener("change", function(){
        var file = this.files[0]; /* now you can work with the file list */
        var userEmail = 'darthvader@empire.com',
              token = 'USER|1d495165-4953-4457-8b5b-4fcf801e621a',

        var recipient = new SendSecure.Helpers.Participant( { email: 'lukeskywalker@rebels.com' } );
        var contactMethod = new SendSecure.Helpers.ContactMethod({ destinationType: "cell_phone", destination: "+15145550000" });
